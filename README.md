## üî• Day 1 ‚Äì Active Directory Lab Setup

**Goal:**  
Set up a real Active Directory environment inside a virtual lab using Windows Server 2019.

**Highlights:**
- ‚úÖ Installed Windows Server 2019 with Desktop Experience in VirtualBox
- ‚úÖ Renamed the server and promoted it to Domain Controller (`andreas.local`)
- ‚úÖ Installed Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- ‚úÖ Created Organizational Units (OUs): IT, Sales, HR, Interns
- ‚úÖ Created sample users: j.choi, c.ramirez, s.mendez, intern.julie

**Reflections:**  
Even just spinning up a Server VM and seeing the full AD interface gave me a new level of appreciation for the backbone of enterprise IT. i also want to be completely honest... this basic set up alone took me about 5 hours, a ton of google searches, downloads, youtube, reddit, and AI. I feel like i didnt accomplish a whole lot but at the same time i feel like i took my first baby steps into a entirely new world which is very exciting. Looking forward to tommorow and getting deeper into the weeds and exploring some more.

**Next Up:** (Day 2!!! 07/23/2025)
- Add Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
- Set login restrictions and password policies
- Simulate lockouts + resets
