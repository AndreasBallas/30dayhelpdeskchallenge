# Day 3 â€“ Group Policy Struggles (but Progress!)

### ðŸ§  What I worked on:
- Created a GPO named `INTERNS GPO tasks`
- Linked it to the `INTERNS` OU
- Configured:
  - Disable Task Manager
  - Set a desktop background image
- Applied security filtering (added Domain Users, Neyger, and Admins)

### ðŸ›‘ What went wrong:
- Tried to test the GPO on a client VM using Windows 10 **Home**
- Hit a wall: Home editions **canâ€™t join domains**, so GPO didnâ€™t apply
- Spent hours troubleshooting logon permissions, OU structure, and login rights

### âœ… What I learned:
- GPO linking, security filtering, OU targeting
- Domain login policies and Local Security Policy
- How to troubleshoot logon errors
- That **Windows 10 Pro is required** to test GPOs

### ðŸ“¸ Screenshots:

---

Will install Windows 10 Pro tomorrow and **come back to test it all properly**.
