## Day 2 â€“ Help Desk Ticketing Practice

Today I simulated a Tier 1 ticketing workflow using:

- âœ… Zoho Desk (to create, track, and escalate support tickets)
- âœ… Google Sheets (to log and summarize ticket resolution steps)

ðŸ”§ I worked through some very common issues like:
- MFA lockouts
- Outlook sync failures
- Printer and keyboard errors
- VPN disconnects

ðŸ§  Practiced:
- Categorizing tickets
- Writing resolution summaries
- Tracking tools used and tags

This was a great intro into how Tier 1 help desk agents manage ticket queues efficiently and also just an intro into what the workflow may be like in general. .

ðŸ“¸ Some screenshots are included below.
